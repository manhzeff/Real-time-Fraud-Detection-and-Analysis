## üéØ Project Objective

This project aims to build a **scalable**, **containerized** fraud detection and analytics pipeline using modern data engineering and machine learning tools. It supports real-time data streaming, robust validation, multi-stage storage, orchestrated ETL, automated model training/tracking, and insightful visualization.

---

## üê≥ Docker-ized Ecosystem

The entire infrastructure is containerized using **Docker** and **Docker Compose**. This ensures:
* **Reproducibility:** Consistent environments across development and deployment.
* **Scalability:** Easily scale individual services as needed.
* **Isolation:** Services run independently, minimizing conflicts.
* **Simplified Deployment:** Streamlined setup and teardown.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Core Components Breakdown

### 1. **üêç Synthetic Transaction Generator**
- **Tool:** Python script using the **Faker** library.
- **Purpose:** Generates simulated financial transaction data in real-time, mimicking real-world patterns.
- **Output:** Streams generated JSON messages directly into a Kafka topic.

---

### 2. **‚òÅÔ∏è Kafka Streaming & Validation Service**
- **Platform:** **Apache Kafka** (managed via **Confluent Cloud**).
- **Function:** Acts as the central message bus, decoupling producers and consumers.
- **Validation:** A dedicated microservice (or Kafka Streams application) consumes raw messages:
    - ‚úÖ **Valid:** Messages conforming to the expected schema are forwarded to a `validated-transactions` topic.
    * ‚ùå **Invalid:** Messages failing validation (schema errors, missing fields, etc.) are routed to **Elasticsearch** for logging, monitoring, and alerting.

---

### 3. **üì¶ Storage Layer: Amazon S3**
- **Service:** **Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)**.
- **Structure:** Utilizes multiple buckets or prefixes for different data stages:
    - `Raw`: Unprocessed data, landed directly from Kafka (or via a connector).
    - `Processed`: Cleaned, validated, and potentially enriched data.
    - `Sandbox`: Data prepared specifically for ML model training or ad-hoc analysis.
- **Processing:** **PySpark** jobs read from one stage, perform transformations, and write to the next, often triggered by Airflow.

---

### 4. **‚úàÔ∏è ETL Orchestration & Scheduling**
- **Orchestrator:** **Apache Airflow**.
- **Function:** Manages complex workflows (DAGs), schedules tasks (like Spark jobs, dbt runs), handles dependencies, retries, and monitors pipeline execution.
- **Supporting Services:**
    - **Redis:** Used as a Celery broker (if using CeleryExecutor) or for caching.
    - **PostgreSQL:** Stores Airflow metadata (DAG states, task instances, logs, connections).

---

### 5. **üßä Data Warehouse & Transformation**
- **Warehouse:** **Snowflake**.
- **Loading:** Processed data from S3 is loaded into Snowflake tables.
- **Staging:** Data initially lands in `STAGING` schemas/tables.
- **Transformation:** **dbt (data build tool)** transforms staging data into analytics-ready `PRODUCTION` models (tables/views) using SQL-based logic.
- **Validation:** **Great Expectations** integrates into the pipeline (often triggered by Airflow or dbt) to run data quality checks against warehouse tables.

---

### 6. **ü§ñ Machine Learning Lifecycle (MLOps)**
- **Training:** ML fraud detection models (e.g., Isolation Forest, XGBoost) are trained, typically using data from the S3 `Sandbox` or Snowflake. Training jobs are often scheduled via **Airflow**.
- **Tracking:** **MLflow** tracks experiments, parameters, metrics, and model versions.
    - **PostgreSQL:** Can be used as the backend store for MLflow metadata.
- **Storage:** **MinIO** (or S3) serves as the artifact store for saving trained model files, scalers, etc., linked via MLflow.

---

### 7. **üìä Monitoring & Visualization**
- **Data Issues:** **Elasticsearch** stores records of invalid/failed transactions from the initial validation step. Kibana (part of the Elastic Stack) can be used for dashboards on data quality issues.
- **Business Intelligence:** **Power BI** connects directly to **Snowflake** (PRODUCTION tables) to build interactive dashboards visualizing fraud trends, key metrics, and model insights for business users.

## üìä Power BI Dashboards

### 1. Fraud Detection Trends

This dashboard visualizes trends in fraudulent transactions over time, segmented by various features such as country, transaction type, and device.

## ‚úÖ Data Quality Monitoring

Data integrity is crucial. We leverage **Great Expectations**:
* **Schema Validation:** Ensures columns exist and have the correct data types.
* **Value Checks:** Validates ranges, non-null constraints, and set memberships.
* **Distributional Checks:** Monitors statistical properties of the data.
* **Integration:** Checkpoints are often run as tasks within Airflow DAGs or as part of dbt runs.
* **Alerting:** Failed validation results can trigger Airflow task failures or custom alerts (e.g., logging to Elasticsearch, Slack notifications).

---

## üìà Example Dashboards & Insights

Visualizations in **Power BI** (or Kibana for data quality) typically include:
* **Fraud Overview:** Volume/value of fraudulent vs. legitimate transactions over time.
* **Pattern Analysis:** Fraud rates by country, payment method, device type, time of day.
* **Model Performance:** Key metrics (AUC, Precision, Recall, F1-score) for the deployed fraud model.
* **Feature Insights:** Feature importance plots (e.g., SHAP values) explaining model predictions.
* **Data Quality Issues:** Number of invalid records, types of validation failures over time (from Elasticsearch/Kibana).
